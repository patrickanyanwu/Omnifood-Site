This project was made to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to produce responsive websites. The website is hosted <a href="https://omnifood-patricka.netlify.app/">here</a> and the files used in making this is shown above. Omnifood is an artificial company and the information used to build the website was provided from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-ee83c900-1d54-4c0a-a0b7-5659bc03d7d4/">Jonas Schmedtmann's Course</a> that I completed.
